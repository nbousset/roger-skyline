Network &amp; system administration initiation project

This project consists of setting up a virtual machine and configure it to host a basic web server. It covers the following topics:
* VM creation and disk partitioning
* network configuration
* ssh configuration
* network security
* tasks automation
* web service

The firewall configuration succesfully protected the server against slowloris' DoS attacks and contains nmap's basic port scanning.
The website consists in a simple login page (sign up/in/out). A database on the VM stores members' email addresses and encrypted passwords.
