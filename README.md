Network &amp; system administration initiation project

This project consists of setting up a virtual machine and configure it to host a basic web server. It covers the following topics:
* VM creation and disk partitioning
* basic network configuration
* ssh configuration
* firewall configuration
* tasks automation
* creation of a basic website

The firewall configuration succesfully protected the server against slowloris' DoS attacks. Nmap's basic port scanning (SYN, ACK, NULL, XMAS packets) reports that all ports are closed, even when specifying a target port.
