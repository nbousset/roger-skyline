# Create the certificate and the key:
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/roger-skyline.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/roger-skyline.crt
# Create a Diffie-Hellman group (to generate a short term key for every session)
openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048

Modify the server block in the website conf file:
-change the listening port from 80 to 443
-add the paths of the cert and key in the server block:
	ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/roger-skyline.crt;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/roger-skyline.key;
-configure ssl as needed

Create a new server block listening on port 80 to redirect to port 443:
	return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
